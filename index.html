      Hi. I have a great interest in new technologies. For the summer of 2014, I have decided to learn Ruby and Ruby on Rails. 
    </p>
    <p>I am a recent graduate of Syracuse University with a BS in Information Management and Technology. During my college career, I have served as an Information Management & Systems Intern for Oxfam America, acted as a teaching assistant for a computer networking class, and acted as a cabinet member for Alpha Phi Omega Phi Chapter.  
    </p>
    <p>For high school, I attend Prospect Hill Academy Charter School in Cambridge, Ma. As a high school student, I had an internship at MIT, taught elementary English to fourth graders in Antigua, Guatemala , and attend an “aboard” program called Cityterm. </p>
    <p>Want to contact me?</p>
    <p>If you are ever in the Boston area, we could grab coffee. You can email me at edwinchalumeau@outlook.com. </p>
